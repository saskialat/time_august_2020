    <h1> Time </h1>

        Time management had always been a problem for me, I guess this is why I am submitting this supposed blog post through google docs instead;)
        <br>
        Speaking of time, although timers are very simple and isn’t the most jarring piece of technology, it is one of the greatest technology for me. At least in a sense of utility.
        Timers allow us, humans, to count something that might seem relative in a tangible way. In old times, determining the time is constrained by seeing daylight and moonlight. However, today we do know the “time” to reach sunset depends on the weather and climate in that certain region. This could cause confusion because we do know that there is no such thing as a border that defines the difference of weather and climate, therefore nothing defines a true boundary of time span in space, it is rather a continuum. Without the timezone set, a socio-political construct determined by said sovereignties, time as a collective measure to determine society’s way of interaction is relative. That is to say, individually time is also relative, this is why 5 minutes of time waiting in front of a microwave and 5 minutes of time watching a movie can go by very differently. 
        I guess what I’m saying doesn’t really have anything to do with technology, it is rather the reason why the advancement of this old technology in human civilization is so important to me. But I think appreciating the reason why we find the technology we have today can give us a moment of reflection to invent technology in the future
